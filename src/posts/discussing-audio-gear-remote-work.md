## Wired Headsets

The Havit HV-H2002D is a great option: reasonably priced, comfortable, durable, and equipped with a good microphone. It’s large and heavy for travel, but the trade-off is worth it since it's not fragile. You can easily replace the synthetic leather cushions with fabric ones.

The synthetic braided mesh reinforcement adds weight and structure to the cable, causing it to hang straight from the laptop to the ground before reaching the headset. This prevents it from resting on your keyboard or body, making it less distracting during use.

## Wired Earbuds

The best wired earbuds are Apple’s EarPods. They are relatively cheap, lightweight, compact, and have a decent microphone. However, they are fragile and may not last long, especially if you frequently toss them onto the table after use.

After using them for a while, I found they hurt my ears due to their shape. I prefer headphones or headsets because I need something comfortable for all-day use at the computer.

Between USB-C and 3.5mm connectors, it’s best to check your laptop layout before deciding which is more practical. On many laptops, the 3.5mm audio jack is located on the left side, which can be convenient for right-handed users, keeping the cable out of the way of your mouse hand. USB-C ports are often placed on the right side, which might result in the cable running between your keyboard and mouse or directly over one of them.

## About Bluetooth...

I tested the Edifier W830NB but had to return it. This model used DNN-based noise reduction, which consistently cut off the beginning of my speech, making effective communication during calls nearly impossible.

Bluetooth audio gear is great for listening to music, but it's not ideal for remote meetings unless paired with a separate microphone. Built-in mics are typically low-quality, positioned near the ear, and Bluetooth bandwidth limitations force the use of lower-quality audio codecs.

In terms of usability, compared with wired audio gear, it's annoying to have to turn the device on and wait a few seconds for Bluetooth to connect instead of simply putting on a headset that's already connected. The upside is that it allows you to walk around the house, grab some water, or use the bathroom while still on a call.

Bluetooth audio devices require you to press and hold a button for a few seconds to power them on or off. If you frequently turn them on and off to conserve battery, this can quickly become frustrating. If you forget to turn them off overnight, the lack of an auto-sleep mode can cause the battery to drain. While they usually have a blinking light to indicate they're powered on, this can be distracting in a dark room at night.
