## Explanation and Solution

I noticed that my profile picture appeared blurry when I accessed my blog on my iPad. After searching for a solution, I found that forum users typically recommend using `quality={100}` or `unoptimized={true}`, but these options didn't fix my problem.

After an analysis of the DOM elements generated by `next/image`, I realized that the issue was due to it expecting an image with double the render size. This is to improve quality on high-density displays (like Retina Display for Apple devices).

If you open DevTools and inspect the document, you'll see that the generated `<img>` tag looks something like this:

```html[class="line-numbers"]
<img
  {...}
  srcset="
    {...}/profile.jpg&amp;w=128 1x,
    {...}/profile.jpg&amp;w=256 2x
  "
  src="{...}/profile.jpg&amp;w=256"
>
```

Notice that it not only uses `src` but also `srcset`. The [srcset property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset) is used to provide additional sources based on some conditions. In this example, if the display's pixel density is 1x, the image used is `128x128` (my original image). If the pixel density is 2x (as on the iPad), it uses a `256x256` image.

**So the problem was actually that I was storing the picture with resolution `128x128` (because that was the resolution to be rendered on my component) but for high-density displays it actually needs to use `256x256`. So, I simply had to double the resolution of my image and `next/image` would handle the rest.**

## Another Example

[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) is a well-known developer in the Next.js community that now works directly at Vercel. From his screenshots, he appears to use a MacBook.

While investigating this issue, I checked his blog for clues and noticed that when using `next/image`, he needed to divide the dimensions by 2 to ensure that images are appropriately sized for 1x and 2x displays.

[Example from his repository](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/369a5421d2d8f9d491548a27cf4eee6c912b3602/content/mysql-planetscale.mdx?plain=1#L65)

```tsx[class="line-numbers"]
<Image
  alt={`Exporting data from Firebase`}
  src={`/images/mysql-planetscale/firebase.png`}
  width={2905 / 2}
  height={1959 / 2}
/>
```

I checked the image stored in `/public` and the resolution is `2905x1959`.

## Intrinsic Size

If you hover over the `srcset`, you'll see some useful information:

![Details on hover](/images/fixing-blurry-images-next/hover.png)

It indicates that the `intrinsic size` is double the original resolution on 2x pixel density displays. It downloads the double-sized image and renders it in the space intended for `128x128` because the screen has twice the normal pixel density.

## Tip for Working With SVG

I noticed a few users on forums complaining about their SVG being blurred. To fix this, instead of using `next/image`, render the SVG directly in the browser: [Working With SVGs in React](/posts/working-with-svgs-in-react-using-svgr)

## Rant

To be fair, Vercel [mentions this in the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#responsive-images), although the explanation is near the end.

Thinking back now, the solution to the problem may seem pretty obvious. It's just that when you create a component and put it as `128x128` you maybe won't realize that it needs to be filled with `256x256` because of these high-density displays. How are we supposed to remember to always double the resolution because a pixel is not really just a pixel?

My laptop doesn't have a high-density screen, so I'm only aware of the problem now because I recently paid premium in an Apple product. So I wonder how many people aren't aware that their images may actually be blurry in their blog posts, social media, portfolios etc?
