## Display manager

A <dfn>display manager</dfn>, or login manager, is a user interface that lets the user input the password to log into the system.

The login manager automatically connects with previously paired Bluetooth devices (for KDE and GNOME), but you may need to press any button and wait about 5 seconds for it to connect.

But if you buy a combo that comes with a USB receiver, it will solve this login problem as it connects directly to the receiver.

## Keyboard

Most Logitech keyboards do not include a USB receiver, so I recommend buying a mouse that has it included and sharing it with both devices. Just make sure that both use the same technology (Unifying or Bolt).

To pair new devices with the USB receiver, you can use the Linux app called `Solaar` (or use Logi Options+ on Windows).

As a digital nomad, I was looking for a keyboard with a compact size. I bought the `MX Keys Mini`, which has a 5-month internal battery (with the backlight off). An alternative is the `Pebble Keys 2 K380s`, which lasts for 36 months by using 2x AAA batteries.

## Mouse

I bought the `MX Master 3S`. It has a 70-day internal battery, Magspeed scrolling, Quiet Clicks, and includes the Logi Bolt.

Alternatives are `MX Anywhere 3S` (70-day internal battery, Magspeed scrolling, Quiet Clicks, but Logi Bolt **not** included) and `Signature M650 L` (24-month 1x AA battery, Smartwheel scrolling, Quiet Clicks, and includes the Logi Bolt).

There is also the `MX Vertical`. It has a 4-month internal battery, but has an old scrolling mechanism (Precision wheel), does **not** have Quiet Clicks, and includes the old USB receiver version (Unifying). I would recommend only for people who already have hand pain.
